# Quantum Key Hunt Unity3D VR

This project was developed as part of the Computer Graphics exam at the University of Florence. The aim of the project is to create a game using Unity3D for VR, specifically for the Meta Quest 2.

The game consists of three main levels, including a tutorial. In the game, the player must shoot and destroy targets using a weapon. For every set number of targets destroyed, a character of the final password is unlocked. The player will need the full password to complete the level.

The game features two main weapons, a system for destroying walls through explosions, and additional tools such as a flashlight and a laser.

The Unity version used for this project is 2022.3.38f1.

Below are some screenshots and GIFs from the game (please note that the in-game visual quality in the headset is significantly higher than shown here).

In the Media folder, you can also find a video showcase of the game.
